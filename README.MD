- Bucket sort

The software applies the selected algorithm to your array (the array can be generated automatically) and displays the result

## What the software can do.
#### Basic:

- 4 kinds of sorting and 2 kinds of searching
- isplays the execution time of the algorithm
- you can turn on the graph display
- displays detailed information about the selected algorithm

#### Array generation:

- array generation in order
- generation of a random array
- it is possible to specify the size of the required array
